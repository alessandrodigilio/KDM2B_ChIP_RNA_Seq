# KDM2B-mediated PRC1 recruitment to chromatin: RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analysis
This project analyses RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq datasets from the paper: "Impaired KDM2B-mediated PRC1 recruitment to chromatin causes defective neural stem cell self-renewal and ASD/ID-like behaviors (GAo Y et al, 2022)"
The study investigates the role of KDM2B in neural stem cell self-renewal and how its dysfunction leads to developmental and behavioural deficits.

Data Sources:
GEO Accession 
- SuperSeries: GSE190807
- RNA-Seq Subseries: GSE190806
- ChIP-Seq subseries: GSE190805 (KDM2B in WT and KDM2b-mutant samples)
Objectives:
- Differential expression analysis on the RNA-Seq dataset to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
- Exploring ChIP-Seq data to highlight differences in chromatin binding between wild-type (WT) and Kdm2b-mutant samples.
- Study of the ChIP-Seq assay to analyse chromatin recruitment dynamics influenced by KDM2B mutations.

Workflow:
1) Data pre-processing and quality control.
2) RNA-Seq DEG analysis.
3) ChIP-Seq peak analysis and comparison between WT and mutant samples.
